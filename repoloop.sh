# This script combines the last sync dates and times for each repository with the
# repository label known to yum, for each organization.  If an argument is supplied, it will only print
# the information for the supplied label.
#
# For Red Hat repositories, labels are pulled from the repository set information.  For non-Red Hat
# repositories, labels are pulled from the repository information.  This maintains consistency with
# what yum expects.
#
# Disclaimer:  This script is provided "as is", without support by either Red Hat or by its author.

# The "strip" function allows us to get the second column from a "hammer ... info" output.  Including multiple fields
# in the awk term allows us to cleanly include timestamps from the "Updated:" line, while the last "sed" term removes
# the extra colons that appear when we apply that awk term to lines that don't include dates.  This allows us to use
# one filter for many cases.
